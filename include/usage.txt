The simplest way is to include "vase_renderer_draft1_2.cpp" and it 
should work.

You should not include "vector_operations.h" or
"vertex_array_holder.h" directly. It may break things. They are included
by "vase_renderer_draft1_2.cpp".

To compile "vase_renderer_draft1_2.cpp" separately, you should create an
empty cpp file and define/ typedef the structs Vec2 and Color BEFORE
"vase_renderer_draft1_2.cpp" as these structs are expected to be
provided by you.
example:
//file vase_renderer.cpp
	struct Vec2 { double x,y;};
	struct Color { float r,g,b,a;};
	#include "vase_renderer_draft1_2.cpp"
//end of file
